# OCD Patient Data Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project is focused on uncovering insights in the trends associated with patients diagnosed with Obsession-Compulsion Disorder (OCD) through a detailed examination of a comprehensive dataset comprising 1500 individuals.
The primary objective of this project is to analyse demographic and clinical characteristics that may influence the manifestaion and treatment of OCD.


### Data Scources

The dataset used in this analysis is fictional and contains 1,500 patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. It includes demographic and clinical information such as Y-BOCS scores, OCD subtypes, and co-occurring conditions.

### Tools
  - Python Pandas : Data Cleaning and Manipulation
  - Python Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data Visulaisation
  - Python Scipy : Scientific and Technical computing

### Data cleaning and preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following steps were performed:
  1. Data inspection: Reviewed the dataset for missing or inconsistent values.
  2. Handling missing values: Addressed missing values in relevant columns, particularly in demographic and clinical information.
  3. Data transformation: Reformatted the columns for consistency, such as ensuring all dates were in a standard format, and transformed the Y-BOCS score into categorical ranges.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
#### KEY AREA OF EXPLORATION WITHIN THIS DATASET INCLUDE:
    - Demographic Characteristics:
        o Understanding the age, gender and geographical distribution of individuals diagnosed with OCD to identify potential patterns and differences across populations.
    - Duration of Symptoms:
        o Analysing how long patients have been experiencing OCD Symptoms. This information can provide valuable context for treatment approaches and understanding the chronicity of the disorder.
    - Y-BOCS Scores:
        o Utilizing the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score to gauge the severity of OCD symptoms among the population, which can inform treatment efficacy and degree of impact on patients daily lives.
    - Co-occuring Mental Health Conditions:
        o Investigating the presence of other mental health disorders that often accompany OCD, such as anxiety disorders and depression, understanding these relationships can help in designing more comrehensive treatment plans.
