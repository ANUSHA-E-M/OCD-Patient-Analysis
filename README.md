### Data cleaning and preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following steps were performed:
  - Data inspection: Reviewed the dataset for missing or inconsistent values.
  - Handling missing values: Addressed missing values in relevant columns, particularly in demographic and clinical information.
  - Data transformation: Reformatted the columns for consistency, such as ensuring all dates were in a standard format, and transformed the Y-BOCS score into categorical ranges.
